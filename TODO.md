## Run 2 — Lecture 2: PyTorch, Resource Accounting

Video kuYAsz7zspQ (77 min). Executable lecture (`lecture_02.py`, 856 lines) —
source-text, no deck.

### Course material
- [x] raw/slides/02-pytorch-resource-accounting.md — transcribe lecture_02.py
      (1187 lines; runtime @inspect values recomputed, GPU-dependent ones marked
      machine-dependent and not reproduced)

### Transcript
- [x] 02 — verbatim captions fetched (101 paragraphs, ~12.2k words)
- [x] 02 — copy-edited transcript (drafted by Sonnet, adjudicated here)
- [x] 02 — verify: all three checks pass. Timestamps: 101 markers, identical
      sequence. Numbers: every difference accounted for (exponent joins, spoken
      dimension names -> seq1/hidden2, one caption stutter, one 1989->1979 fix
      confirmed by source). Word ratios: 4 outliers at 0.66-0.72 read and
      confirmed as filler removal, 1 at 1.22 is an inserted [Ed:] note.
      Adjudication restored 2 dropped passages, reverted 1 unsafe number
      restoration, and added 8 [Ed:] notes. All 24 restored proper nouns appear
      verbatim in the lecture source.

### Wiki
- [x] wiki/02-pytorch-resource-accounting.md (408 lines)
- [x] Topic pages (8 new) — resource-accounting, flops-and-mfu,
      arithmetic-intensity, training-flops, memory-accounting-for-training,
      precision-and-data-types, einops, activation-checkpointing
- [x] Update existing pages that now link a second lecture — efficiency,
      course-map, executable-lectures, AGENTS.md
- [x] INDEX.md — rewritten for two-lecture coverage
- [x] Link sweep — 222 relative links and 71 anchors all resolve

### Publish
- [x] Update sources.md (lecture_02.py now transcribed)
- [x] kb.json — coverage 2/18, 14 topic pages
- [x] Commit and push
- n/a  kbUrl already set on the catalog entry from run 1; no re-link needed

## Run 3 — Lecture 3: Architectures

Video lVynu4bo1rY (89 min). Tatsunori Hashimoto. **First PDF-deck lecture in this
KB** — `lecture_03.pdf`, 67 pages, so `page-images` rather than `source-text`.

Numbering: the deck prints **no page numbers on any page**. `slide_number_map.py`
reported "printed numbers run 1-1" from a stray `1` on page 61 that is the
numerator of the MQA arithmetic-intensity fraction, not a folio. Mapping is a
plain 1..67, page N = slide N, and `--verify` must use the Python fallback.

### Course material
- [x] raw/slides/03-architectures.md — all 67 pages read (Opus), 2058 lines
- [x] Figure audit — 8 pages (11, 12, 46, 50, 52, 55, 63, 67) checked against the
      PDF at 600-1200 dpi. 6 clean; 3 errors found and fixed: slide 67's MoE
      column is checked on GPT4 and Mixtral (not "unchecked on every row") and
      its Parametrization column carries "MuP" on the Phi3 row (not "empty on
      every row"); slide 55's "Norms" annotation is slide-native text layered ON
      TOP of the meme, visible, not covered by it. The 43x6 numeric table on 67
      was exact cell for cell, as was Table 3 on 63.
- [x] Cross-view table check — slides 7, 29, 51 and 67 are four views of the same
      model database, read in four separate chunks. 296 overlapping (model,
      column) cells compared: 0 disagreements. No second audit run; the sample
      was 6/8 clean and the one error class (a sparse column asserted uniformly
      empty) does not recur on the sibling views, which name their exceptions.
- [x] Heading-sequence check — PASS, exactly 67 headings 1..67 in order

### Transcript
- [x] 03 — verbatim captions fetched (117 paragraphs, ~17.1k words)
- [x] 03 — copy-edited transcript (drafted by Sonnet, adjudicated here)
- [x] 03 — verify: all three checks pass. Timestamps: 117 markers, identical
      sequence. Numbers: 5 differences, all adjudicated — a dropped duplicate "1"
      from the "T5 1.v v1.1" caption stutter, "Gemma's two, three, and four"
      written as digits, and "2"/"11" from an [Ed:] note citing Falcon 2 11B.
      Word ratios: one outlier at 1.11, which falls to 0.93 once the 26-word
      [Ed:] note inserted in that paragraph is excluded. Adjudication reverted
      one unsafe restoration ("Nemotron-4 340B" back to "Nemotron 340B" — slide
      26 prints "Nemotron 340B" and he was reading it) and corrected one wrong
      evidence citation in the header (P-RoPE). All 21 restored proper nouns
      appear verbatim in the deck; 9 [Ed:] notes mark genuine ambiguity.

### Wiki
- [x] wiki/03-architectures.md (249 lines)
- [x] Topic pages (8 new) — model-architecture-survey, pre-norm-and-post-norm,
      rmsnorm, gated-activations, rope, transformer-hyperparameters,
      training-stability, attention-variants
- [x] Update existing pages that now link a third lecture — arithmetic-intensity,
      flops-and-mfu, efficiency, memory-accounting-for-training, tokenization,
      scaling-laws, executable-lectures, course-map
- [x] INDEX.md — three-lecture coverage, new Lecture 3 section, raw-material and
      citation sections rewritten for the two material formats
- [x] Link sweep — 323 relative links and 19 anchors all resolve; every one of the
      25 wiki pages appears in INDEX.md; no LaTeX inside code fences

### Publish
- [x] Update sources.md (lecture_03.pdf now transcribed)
- [x] kb.json — coverage 3/18, 22 topic pages, materials.method now "mixed" with a
      per-lecture breakdown, figuresAudited true
- [x] AGENTS.md — deck conventions now live, not hypothetical; figures rule split
      by lecture format; timestamp check widened to [H:MM:SS]
- [x] Commit and push

## Not done (future runs)
- [ ] Lectures 4–18 — transcripts and wiki pages
- [ ] Transcribe the 7 remaining PDF decks (lectures 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16) — these need
      page-images, not source-text, and a figure audit
- [ ] Transcribe the 7 remaining executable lectures (6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17)
- [ ] Describe the figures in lectures 1 and 2 — the image() targets are recorded
      by path in raw/slides but their contents were never looked at. Lecture 3 now
      sets the precedent for how (page-images plus a targeted figure audit), but
      lectures 1-2 display images by URL rather than as PDF pages, so the mechanics
      differ.
